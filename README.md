Homework #10


"As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles"

You'll be prompted with questions including an employee name, ID, email, and title. Each title has it's own specific questions as well. After questions have been answered you'll be prompted to create your own html page with your team's data displayed.
